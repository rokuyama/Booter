                       BSD/mac68k Booter Change Log
                       ============================

Up until 1.9.4 -- Brian Gaeke <brg@usa.net>
After 1.10.0 -- Nigel Pearson <nigel@ind.tansu.com.au or nigel@socs.uts.edu.au>

This document was originally adapted from notes found in ufs_test.c.

Some quick notes about version numbers and information passing...

Originally, there was the first booter. This booter passed information to the kernel
through registers. Y’know, A4=video, A2=boot flags, and so on. We ran out of
registers fairly quickly.

Then there was the Christmas '94 booter. That booter passed an environment buffer.
The buffer contained arguments specifying interesting parameters to the booter.
That's what the arguments are in ufs_test.c:shutdownProc().

Then there was the generic booter + a version number. That (this) booter specifies
the MacOS video and serial addresses, so that the kernel may maintain contact with
the hardware in the correct locations up until it activates its own page tables,
whether or not MacOS is operating in a mapped environment. There is also a version
field, so that newer kernels can know not to boot from old booters.

Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of booters that have existed. Which of these
correspond to the ones above (or below)?
* Original booter, Summer 1992
* 32-bit booter, September 1993
* nofpu booter, September 1993
* New parameters and 8k-4k (8k didn’t work) booter, December 1993
* Newer parameters booter, 01/26/1994

ChangeLog starts here.
====================================================================================
* Version 5 -- January 26th, 1994 (the “newer parameters booter” above.)
  Fifth in line of booters. This booter, amazingly, should work with ALL previous
  kernels, because parameters have been preserved. Added all parameters below.
====================================================================================
* Version 6 -- Allen did some stuff [what?]
====================================================================================
* Version 1.6 -- Brad added some time variables and some ROM ADB necessitated
  variables; ROMBASE, ADBDELAY, TIMEDBRA. No kernel that depends on this info
  (e.g. MRG kernels) will boot with an earlier Booter.
====================================================================================
* Version 1.7 -- Brad added the setenvbuf() function and added two new variables,
  ADBBASE and EGRETBASE, which actually contain the config info for the ADB and
  Egret systems, so we can reset them properly. (Maybe.)
====================================================================================
* Version 1.8 -- Allen added support for mini-root partition image files, and added 
  routines to set variables directly in the kernel namespace, and cleaned up some.
  Brian added video card sRsrc-searching and VBL disabling code, as well as passing
  of HwCfgFlags and friends as environment variables, dumping of environment
  variables before boot, a pause-before-booting dialog, and a little bit more
  clean-up. It seems setenvbuf() has been disabled.
====================================================================================
* Version 1.9 -- OK, lots of changes described here but not so much real innovation:
  Added “No env dumps” option so that if you don't want to see the environment
  dumped, you don't have to. This will be subsumed in 2.x booters into the
  diagnostic messages settings.

  main.c: Added check for 32-bit mode at booter startup; Booter will refuse to start
  up if the machine wasn’t booted in 32-bit addressing mode.

  appkill.c: added. Booter will now try to send ‘quit’ AppleEvents to all other
  applications before booting.

  ufs_test.c: Added ADBREINIT_JTBL environment variable, 4 bytes at 0xdd8. Flush
  instruction+data caches just before calling copycode(). Make CLEANUP macro try to
  free(buf) if it’s been malloc’d. Added more EVENT_CHECKs to copyunix(). Used
  BootError() in more places.

  videocard.c: video_call() returns an error code. (Hopefully) more informative
  error messages. “Don’t stop the boot when things go wrong.” -Allen. Moved some
  things around in get_video_info so that if there's no place to put the info
  (i.e. an older kernel), it's not gathered.

  strcasecmp.c, strcasestr.c: added (former from BSD libc, latter adapted from Net2
  libc (ok, I had it lying around...)) stricmp() removed.
  
  read_part.c: Revamped get_part_sector() to look at partition names (“Root”,“Swap”)
  as a quick patch until the silly thing can support interpretation of the BZB, in
  response to some bug report or another. Tried to bring in newer BSD headers but
  backed out -- structures weren't aligned properly or something (magic nums were
  wrong, et c.) Maybe later.
====================================================================================
* Version 1.9.1 (M.Hitter)

  main.c, Dialogs.c, MacBSD.h: added Preferences Dialog with DebugLevel. Moved
  “AutoBoot” controls to there.

  Removed some obsolete variables and move VerbosePrintf to DebugPrintf (1,...).
  
  Made modeless Dialogs full working as expected (Event handling etc.).
====================================================================================
* Version 1.9.2 (M.Hitter)

  Reviewed to allow THINK C's option “infer prototypes”, i.e. added a lot of
  prototypes and ‘static’s. Maybe I'm stupid, but I was unable to fix for “required
  prototypes” (the prototype for harry() was the problem).
  
  Added support for logging messages to a logfile.
  
  Moved cache disabling from the end of copyunix() to ShutdownProc().
  Using now the same code as in the kernel.
====================================================================================
* Version 1.9.3beta1 (W. Studenmund)

  Added a Serial Ports... Dialog to control the new serial port options in the
  zsc/zstty serial port driver. Added entries for clocks present on the clock input
  lines, selection of "stty raw" defaults for either port, warning the kernel that
  there might be LocalTalk on the printer port (sets the baud rate to 1), and
  opening the modem for output just before boot (to turn on power to the SCC chip on
  powerbooks).
  
  Moved Serial Echo and Serial Console selection controls to the “Serial Ports...”
  dialog.
  
  Added code to the save and load user configuration routines to deal with no
  preferences being present. LoadUserConfiguration() now just zeros out
  currentConfiguration if no prefs are present, and SaveUserConfiguration() will
  make a preferences resource if needed.
====================================================================================
* Version 1.9.3beta2 -- This is a bug-fix-only release. Major changes are that we
  now test for the presence of the VM system and existence of the _MemoryDispatch
  trap before calling LockMemoryContiguous. Hopefully this squashed the
  “unimplemented trap” crashing bug which was appearing on “minimal install”
  systems. Also, the booter now compiles in CodeWarrior AND in THINK C. (To be
  precise, it has been tested in MW C/C++ 68k v1.5, the version on the CW9 disk, and
  in THINK C 8.0.) The mess resulting from having to deal with the two compilers and
  their two incompatible sets of header files and libraries will be removed after
  version 1.9.3 final, so compiling under THINK C will not be supported for long.

  More user-invisible changes:
  Everywhere: Misc. type & type-cast changes, removed some unused variables,
  Quickdraw globals now use qd. prefix.

  ufs_test.c: The name of the struct exec which holds the a.out header of the kernel
  was changed from x to exec. Better environment printing (i.e. the environment is
  no longer calculated twice - once for printing and once “for real”.) print1env()
  is history. Assembly-language blocks moved into their own functions and MOVEC
  instrs hand-assembled for compatibility with brain-damaged CodeWarrior assembler.
  (A complaint has been lodged with the proper authorities. Grumble.) Low memory
  globals are now accessed by their proper accessor functions where available
  (LMGetXxxxx()). Prototype for harry added (at considerable cost to code
  simplicity.) It compiles in CW9 with “Require Function Prototypes” and in THINK C
  with “Require Prototypes”.

  Dialogs.c: Cleaned code up substantially.

  MacBSD.h: CLEANUP is no longer defined by default to be “while(0);”, now it is
  “/* NOTHING */” by default. Note that this only makes a difference in read_ufs.c.
  Sooner or later, I’m just going to ditch EVENT_CHECK and CLEANUP as they are
  currently implemented.
====================================================================================
* Version 1.9.3 BETA 3 -- Mostly cleanup this time around, with 1 important bug fix
  in dialog code and a whole new way to get the parameters of the main screen using
  the Graphics Device Manager and Color QuickDraw routines.

  Dialogs.c: Fixed bug in GroupSet() which was not taking into account argument
  promotion when retrieving item numbers off the vararg stack.

  main.c: Now we check for availability of 68020+68851 or 68030 or better at booter
  startup time. getRAMSize() and MacOS32BitMapping() moved to machdep.c.

  machdep.c: (added.) Most of the boolean functions that result from interpreting
  Gestalt results have been moved here. getRAMSize is now GetRAMSize, for
  consistency.

  ufs_test.c: Changes to include files. load, lowram and mach are history, as well
  as many other superfluous variables of which I’ve lost track. BootError now works
  like printf(). New max_avail_mem() which should probably migrate to machdep.c.
  Caches are now flushed and disabled before the call to copycode(), only.
  kern_geteof() is history. In copyunix(): Now, load address is LOAD_ADDR (a
  #define.) All the video info comes out of GetMainDevice() and its subsidiary data
  structures; the old code is still there (but #if’d out.) Lots more comments,
  including a try at describing the format of the kernel buffer, and documentation
  of the new algorithms for finding screen parameters. Figured out exactly what /*
  LAK says I need this. */ meant: copycode() must be copied to the end of the
  buffer, which must end on a page boundary. The first two lines round down len to
  the next lowest page boundary, and then harry is assigned to be 1KB below that.
====================================================================================
* Version 1.9.4 -- The new, improved Booter Manual (in HTML) has been included.

  The string+environment size has been doubled to 256KB. Eventually this will
  be fixed for good by allocating it dynamically.

  Mikael Forselius posted a big list of things to do to make the Booter boot
  correctly on the LC475 series machines. This includes changing the way the
  caches are disabled (implemented) and changing (again) the way the video
  address is determined (not implemented yet). More on this in future versions,
  for sure.
====================================================================================
* Version 1.9.5 (Dan Jacobowitz, youngdrow@mail.geocities.com, Nov 22, 1996)
Was available at <http://crab.rutgers.edu/~jacobowi/netbsd>.
Changes: Option for B/W Mode booting! Rearranged prefs dialogs. Fixed the buttons
         in the Untested Machine dialog.
(These changes were subsequently lost in later Booters. Nigel)
====================================================================================
* Version 1.9.5 and 1.9.6 (Allen Briggs, briggs@macbsd.com, Mar 4, 1997)
The main (only?) change I made was to support booting with larger kernels--it
dynamically sizes RAM to account for larger symbol tables. Older versions of the
booter just assumed that the symbol table would be 120K or less...  Many post-1.2
kernels do exceed this size.
====================================================================================
* Version 1.9.7 (Steve Brown, sbrown@best.com, Mar 19, 1997)
Added an “Auto Set GMT bias” checkbox and the code to make the booter automatically
get the GMT offset from the MacOS. Also moved the Centris & Quadra 610 and 650 into
the “tested” machine category.
====================================================================================
* Version 1.10.0 (Allen Briggs, briggs@macbsd.com, Apr 24, 1997)
Added ability to read gzipped kernels. Removed testedMachine	stuff.
====================================================================================
* Version 1.10.1 (Nigel Pearson)
* Never Officially Released
Mainly changes to get it to compile under Think C v7 _and_ CodeWarrior. Added alias
of the resource file (for Think C compilation). Updated versions in ChangeLog and
resource file.

Dialogs.c: Put all of the SMALLFUNC stuff into a new file, DialogMgr.h and added new
           function GroupHilite().
machdep.c: Changed MachineLocation structure de-reference so that it compiles under
           both Think C _and_ CodeWarrior
ufs_test.c: Cast shutdownProc() to (ShutDwnUPP)shutdownProc to match Think C
            prototype for ShutDwnInstall()
BSD_Mac_Booter.rsrc: Updated version numbers and took chopped list of names out of
                     version resources, replacing with “by the NetBSD/Mac68k group”

zlib:    Changed all text files from Unix to Macintosh format, added Think C project
zconf.f: Put (#if !defined (THINK_C) ) wrapper around “Byte” typedef
zutil.h:     Changed start of line 151 to #if defined(__STDC__) to match Think C
====================================================================================
* Version 1.10.2 (Nigel Pearson)
* Never Officially Released
Added new Serial fields to set different default serial port speeds (with a matching
kernel), and a new Monitors dialog which allows you to change the depth of your main
screen before booting. (will also allow you to change the resolution in the future)

Dialogs.c:  Extracted Serial dialog stuff into separate file, Serial.c
main.c:     Added extra menu item for Monitors dialog, and a call to MonitorChange()
            just before booting
MacBSD.h:   Added extra constants for Monitors and Serial dialog, and variables in
            the user configuration structure
Monitors.c: New file containing three functions to handle the new Monitors dialog
            and MonitorChange() which actually changes the depth
Serial.c:   Added a little code for handling the new “Default Port Speed” items
ufs_test.c: Added a few lines to output environment variables for new serial items
BSD_Mac_Booter.rsrc: New dialog resources for Monitors dialog, re-arranged Serial
                     dialog and added new fields, added my name to the About dialog
====================================================================================
* Version 1.10.3b1 (Nigel Pearson, Aug 29, 1997)
Fixed nasty booting problem on IIvx machiness, and small bug where “Auto Set GMT
bias” could be turned on but not off.

Dialogs.c:           Added “currentConfiguration.AutoSetGMT = 0”
machdep.c:           Added dummy function UsingVM();
Monitors.c:          Removed some commented-out code
ufs_test.c:          Removed old (assembler) cache-disabling code (incompat. IIvx)
BSD_Mac_Booter.rsrc: Again took chopped list of names out of version resources,
                     replacing with “by the NetBSD/Mac68k group”
                     (This change somehow was in 1.10.1 but not 1.10.2)
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11b1 (Scott Reynolds & Nigel Pearson, Sep 19, 1997)
Standalone miniroot files are no longer supported, as they have been obsoleted by
in-kernel root filesystems. As a result of the previous, the ‘Miniroot’ field was
deleted from the Boot Options dialog. The minimum and preferred memory sizes have
been set to 2048K and 5120K respectively.
A new check box was added for the root SCSI ID field: ‘Enabled?’ tells the kernel to
construct a boot device cookie based on the root SCSI ID. This has been the case in
the past, and by default this box is checked. The purpose of this option is to allow
systems to boot without a root SCSI ID specified, e.g. using NFS filesystems or
in-kernel miniroots.
The option dialogs had cosmetic cleanup done on them; positions of several items
were adjusted slightly, and the order of items when tabbing through editable text 
fields was made consistent. The dialog brought up by ‘File -> Preferences...’ has
been moved to ‘Options -> Startup...’, as this is more descriptive of its function.
The dialog itself hasn’t changed at all.  Consequently, the ‘Save Options &
Preferences’ menu item is now simply `Save Options’. The ‘About ...’ dialog’s author
list has been split into two columns. It was getting a bit unwieldy.

Dialogs.c : Added DoButtonOutline()
MacBSD.h  : Re-numbered some menus and dialog items
main.c    : When creating empty/initial prefs, clear with MetroWerks memset() and
            set some defaults. Removed MonitorChange() call, disable options menus
            when booting, menu restructure
read_macos.c : Removed miniroot stuff
ufs_test.c   : Updated BOOTERVER env. var., removed miniroot stuff, improved “Not
               enough free memory” message, added a bit in the booting flag for
               setting the boot device cookie thingy, added MonitorChange() call
BSD_Mac_Booter.rsrc  : Re-numbered menus and dialog items, fiddled with positions
Monitors.c, Serial.c : Added DoButtonOutline() call
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.0 (Scott Reynolds, scottr@og.org, Sep 27, 1997)
Fixed code to display outline around default (i.e. OK) buttons.

Dialogs.c            : Added DeDefaultOutline() and SetDialogDefaultOutline()
MacBSD.h             : Renumbered dialog items for extra user item
Monitors.c, Serial.c : Changed DoButtonOutline() call to SetDialogDefaultOutline()
BSD_Mac_Booter.rsrc  : Added user item (for drawing default button's outline) to
                       each dialog, and a few more names to the 'About...' Dialog
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.1b5 (Nigel Pearson, Scott Reynolds, Nov 2, 1997)
Now writes preferences into a separate file. Better handling of Mac OS kernel file.
Some user-interface changes. Moved all common copyright-related stuff (e.g. licence
details) into a new file COPYRIGHT.txt

boot_vfs.c   : Moved all gzip related stuff into a new file, gzip.c
Dialog.c     : Removed stuff relating to Startup Preferences dialog into a new file,
               Startup.c. Added code to use a file requestor to select the Mac OS
               kernel file and to save the resultant FSpec structure
MacBSD.h     : Reworked user_config structure. Added some #defines to easily enable/
               disable gzip code (e.g. #define kernel_read gzboot_read or boot_read)
main.c       : Tidied up error handling logic after calling boot_read. Removed
               Load/SaveUserConfiguration stuff into a new file, Prefs.c
Monitors.c   : Added code to remember and restore monitor depth
read_macos.c : Changed from Unix style io calls to Mac style
BSD_Mac_Booter.rsrc  : Moved debuging-related items from Booting to Startup dialog.
                       Added button to set Mac OS kernel file, separated kernel
                       location items from others in Booting dialog
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.1b7 (Nigel Pearson, Nov 9, 1997)
Changed booting sequence so that the attempt to kill other MacOS applications
(note that this is broken, at least in my testing) happens _before_ the depth change
occurs. This is so that every other app won't have to redraw all of its windows.
Added UI for an optional booting item to get the real version of the mmapped
video_address for LC475 type machines (Mikael Forselius's suggestion from about a
year ago). Killed a few bugs and eliminated unneeded #includes

MacBSD.h   : Moved EVENT_CHECK macro into a new file, event_check.h
Prefs.c    : Fixed 2 bugs;
             1) "Log debugging to file" failed if the "Set" button hadn't been used
                (i.e. there was no default value for the filename)
             2) Modified preferences file code so that the file is only written
                when a "Save Options" is done
ufs_test.c : Removed some #includes and moved kernel console video address stuff
             into a new file, videoaddr.c
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.1b8 (Nigel Pearson, Nov 11, 1997)
Implemented hard-coded video address option for LC475/575 machines (looking up MMU
maps was too hard). Bug fix b7 where video_address was never set (i.e. no console)

ufs_test.c  : Removed extra video_address variable
videoaddr.c : Added hard-coded address
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.1 (Nigel Pearson, Dec 3, 1997)
Improved low-lever SCSI debug output and added sensible(?) errors for wrong SCSI ID

MacBSD.h,
read_disk.c, read_part.c : Added return value for read_scsi,
read_ufs.c               : Print partition name when searching for boot partition
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.2 (Nigel Pearson, Eugenio Macia Vivo, April 18, 1998)
Now checks for a few more things in the MacOS (Virtual Memory, AppleScript, et c.),
correctly kills running applications (a problem with my Think C's project settings),
and allows changing screen resolution and colour mode to greyscale. Also has better
default memory settings

appkill.c           : Added error-checking and Control Strip hiding code
BSD_Mac_Booter.rsrc : Added VM alert and GreyScale box in Monitor dialog
MacBSD.h            : Added ids for above and a few prototypes
machdep.c           : Added HasAppleScript() HasControlStrip() HasDesktopPicture().
                      UsingVM() now checks if logical memory size > physical
main.c              : Check for UsingVM() and popup Alert, changed conditions for
                      hiding 'Boot Now' menu, some tidying up
Monitors.c          : New Display Manager calls to change resolution,
                      and addition of GreyScale mode changing and restoration
RequestVideo.c,
RequestVideo.h,
RequestVideoSC.h    : New stuff for Display manager
ufs_test.c          : Now also calls RestoreDepth() & MonitorChange() if colour mode
                      (e.g. GreyScale) or resolution change requested/happened.
                      Only kills running apps if AppleScript is available.
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.3b3 (Nigel Pearson, May 6, 1998)
User interface changes and addition of 'jump into debugger after booting'

BSD_Mac_Booter.rsrc : Moved some items from Booting to Startup dialog,
                      and added new kernel debugging tick boxes
MacBSD.h            : Id changes for above, additional debug flags in config struct
Dialogs.c Startup.c : Moved items, split 'extra debugging', added new items,
                      removed last traces of "GreyBars"
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.3b4 (Nigel Pearson, July 4, 1998)
Fixed a small bug in 1.11.3b3 where serial booting would fail when both 'Serial Boot
Echo' and 'Serial Console' were used together

Dialogs.c, Serial.c, Startup.c : Normalised boolean configuration fields to 1 or 0
                                 (some were 255 or 0)
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.3b5 (Nigel Pearson, July 5, 1998)
Bug fixes to low-level SCSI code; which would hang the machine if a removable SCSI
device was offline, improvements to error messages when wrong SCSI ID used, some
tidying up of code

BSD_Mac_Booter.rsrc : Made debuglevel input box larger
Dialogs.c           : Removed unused variable
main.c              : Separated main text window stuff into new file, Window.c
Prefs.c             : Changed short WritePrefsFile() to void WritePrefsFile()
read_disk.c         : Better error messages, SCSIComplete() calls to cleanup after
                      error with SCSIRead()
read_ufs.c          : Improved "Partition not found" message
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.3 (Nigel Pearson, July 30, 1998)
Problem with monitor resolution-changing logic fixed

Monitors.c : Changed logic, which was using unneeded Display Manager call for depth-
             only changes
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.4a1 (Nigel Pearson, September 30, 1998)
Created new machine dialog, added alert (and disabling code) for PPCs, moved some
items, added MACHINEID changing

BSD_Mac_Booter.rsrc : New alert and dialog, moved some items, tidied and added
                      defaults to alerts
Dialogs.c           : "Disabled" changing of GMT bias unless 'Auto-set GMT Bias'
                      is set, moved video hack, VBL interrupt and RAM stuff to
                      new dialog (Machine.c), added new dialog to Options menu,
                      some tidying up
machdep.c           : Added RunningOnPPC()
main.c              : New alert on PPC machines
Prefs.c             : Added initialisation for MACHINEID
Serial.c            : Fix for highlighting problem in serial console radio buttons
ufs_test.c          : CodeWarrior compile fix (for sys/reboot.h), MACHINEID
                      override, abort boot before disabling VBL interrupts on PPC
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.4a2 (Marc LaViolette, Nigel Pearson, March 10, 1999)

Prefs.c           : Automatic version stuff from version resource
Output.c,
read_macos.c,
read_ufs.c,
ufs_test.c,
videocard.c       : Some incorrect calls to ErrorPrintf() became Output() ====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.5a1 (Nigel Pearson, June 23, 1999)
Does some additional checking for Mac partitioned disks

MacBSD.h    : Added prototype for read_Block0()
read_disk.c : Added read_Block0()
read_part.c : Changes a few '512's to 'SECTOR_SIZE' and 'scsid' to 'SCSIid',
              added some extra debug, get_part_sector() now calls read_Block0()
              to check is disk is Mac partitioned

====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.5a2 (Nigel Pearson, June 24, 1999)
Backwards compatibility with Think C v6 (partly by disabling Display manager code)

Allegro_finale.c, DialogMgr.h,
Dialogs.c, MacBSD.h, machdep.c,
Monitors.c, Prefs.c, RequestVideo.h, ufs_test.c : Think C v6 changes
reboot.h : Moved from sub folder 'sys' to source directory & renamed 'sys/reboot.h'
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.5a3 (Nigel Pearson, August 29, 2000)
UI and code for reading partitions from IDE disks

ATA.h               : Stolen from Apple's Universal Headers (not in Think C or CW9)
boot_vfs.c, gzip.c  : boot_open() & gzboot_open() now accept a device and partition
BSD_Mac_Booter.rsrc : ATA UI, Y2K in copyrights
Dialogs.c           : ATA disk UI stuff
MacBSD.h            : Added ATA UI stuff, device enum & struct, updated prototypes
machdep.c           : Added TrapAvailable(), HasATA(),
                      ATA addition and bugfix in OutputMachineDetails()
MacUFS.h            : Removed prototypes of stuff in read_ufs.c
main.c              : Changes in load_and_boot() for ATA disks
read_disk.c         : New ATA structures, read_disk(), disk_name() and read_ata(),
                      device structure for read_Block0()
read_part.c         : get_part_entry() & get_part_sect() now accept a device struct
read_ufs.c          : fdtable struct and several functions now have a device struct,
                      name/device guessing code extracted from ufs_open()
RequestVideo.h      : Uncommented element in structure for some unknown reason
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.5a4 (Nigel Pearson, September 5, 2000. Source accidentally deleted?)
Compilation fixes for Think C v6

ATA.h      : Extra types, and removal of duplicate typedef
ufs_test.c : copyunix() now correctly reduces length when page aligning buffer,
             automatically detect compiler jump table when copying copycode()
====================================================================================
* Version 1.11.5a5 (Nigel Pearson, January 3, 2002)
IDE fixes

main.c      : VM alert now will not appear if on PPC machine (for testing)
read_part.c : Continue boot if kATAMgrGetDrvConfiguration fails, some extra debug
====================================================================================
