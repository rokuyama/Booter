                         Recommended Booter versions

Version: 1.9.4, October 1st, 1996
Author: Brian Gaeke
   * First Booter to support any 68040 (i.e. Quadra-class) machines. Known to
     boot kernels from NetBSD/Mac68k versions 1.1 and later. For kernels older
     than 1.1, your mileage may vary -- in theory the support is still there,
     but it's not been tried in quite a while

Version: 1.11.1, December 3rd, 1997
Authors: Scott Reynolds, Nigel Pearson
   * User interface improvements, plus the following changes from earlier versions:
   + Allows booting with larger kernels (many post 1.2 kernels require this Booter)
   + New 'Auto Set GMT bias' checkbox which uses the 'Map' Mac OS Control panel
     to set Unix's time zone information
   + New ability to boot from gzip-ed kernel files
   + New serial fields to set different default serial port speeds
   + New Monitors options which allow changing of the main screen depth before
     booting
   + If boot is aborted, resets monitor depth
   + Saves preferences in a separate file, rather than in the program's resources
   + Added video address hack for LC475/LC575 Macs' console on internal video
   + Handles kernels in Mac OS files much better
   + Better debugging/error output for low-level SCSI stuff

Version: 1.11.4, June 22nd, 1999
Authors: Nigel Pearson, Marc LaViolette, Mikael Forselius
   * New 'Machine' dialog for hardware specific options, fixes for testing on PPCs
   * Support for Sonnet Allegro accellerator, ability to change MACHINEID passed
     into the kernel, plus the following changes from earlier versions:
   + User interface changes and addition of 'jump into debugger after booting'
   + Bug fixes (serial booting, hang if a removable SCSI device was offline,
     problem with monitor depth & resolution-changing logic)
   + Booter now checks for Virtual Memory, and pops up an alert and exits if used
   + Monitors options now allow changing of main screen's resolution and colour mode
     (to greys) before booting. The latter is for some of the new Xservers which
     don't work with colour yet
   + Now correctly kills running applications

Version: 2.0.0, August 19th, 2002
Authors: Nigel Pearson, Joe Laffey, Christian Groessler
   * Allows booting from ELF kernels
   * Keeps removable disks mounted (i.e. no ejection) during boot
   * Ability to boot from disklabelled disks
     plus the following changes from earlier versions:
   + Initial support for booting from ATA/IDE disks
   + Fix for gzip re-entrancy bug
   + Some debugging improvements and PPC testing improvements
