                       Booter improvement/to do list
                       -----------------------------
   Bugs:

* Add workaround for having to reset PRAM on AV Macs

* Cancel buttons do not cancel changes made in some dialogs

* Problems with "Minimum Install"s of the Mac OS ?


   User Interface / Functionality:

* Disable AppleTalk option (CommSlot machines need AppleTalk on the interface at
  restart time to initialise the card, but off at boot time else the kernel hangs?)

* Eliminate warning when selecting locked MacOS kernel files

* Ability to "Drag and Drop" a kernel file onto the booter?
  This would either just set the MacOs kernel file, or do an "Open and Boot"

* Multiple Monitor re-ordering and maybe depth/resolution changing.

* Printable/Clearable log window ?

* Redraw log window after 'Cancel' in Boot/Cancel dialog

* Simple Booter extension (like Das-Boot?) which uses the same preferences file ?

* Ability to open preferences from multiple prefs files, or multiple sets of
  preferences in the one prefs file

* A single Preferences dialog that has all options, on different pages? Could use a
  left scroll box with different icons to set up different options, a la System 6's
  Control Panels, or maybe a tabbed interface. (Scott Reynolds, 15th September 1997)

* Nifty triangle or popup thing for selecting disk (SCSIid and/or buss) and
  partition to boot off. Could also be used my MkFs and the Installer

* Set 8-bit colourmap for non fully-supported graphics setups ?

   Kernels stored under MacOs:

* Add ability to boot from tarred kernels (e.g. netbsd.tar or netbsd.tar.gz)
