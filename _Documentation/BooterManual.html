The BSD/Mac68k Booter is a MacOS application which boots the NetBSD/Mac68k
(and OpenBSD/Mac68k) operating system.

<CENTER> <A NAME="WhatIsMacBSD"><H2>What the heck is NetBSD/Mac68k?</H2></A> </CENTER>

NetBSD/Mac68k, also known as MacBSD, is a port of the UNIX-like operating system NetBSD to
the Motorola 680x0 processor-based family of Macintosh computers. For more general
information on NetBSD/Mac68k, point your web browser at any of the following sites...

The minimum hardware configuration includes a 68020 with a 68851 PMMU chip or a 68030 or
better processor, without which the Booter will refuse to start. The Booter has been tested
recently under System 7.1 and 7.5 (both minimal and full installs), but it should work under
any System 7 setup. System 6.0.x is not supported because the Booter requires the machine to
be booted in 32-Bit Addressing mode. The Booter also will certainly fail if Virtual Memory
is enabled, so turn that off too while you're snooping around in the Memory control panel.
<P>
The Macintosh models that are supported to some extent by NetBSD/Mac68k vary on what
seems to be a daily basis sometimes. Check <A HREF="#MacBSDWebSites">the web sites</A>,
and especially the user survey contained therein, for more information.

<CENTER> <A NAME="HowToBoot"><H2>How do I boot this silly thing!?</H2></A> </CENTER>

First and foremost you must have formatted/partitioned and installed BSD
on a hard drive or similar. This can be accomplished using MacOS tools
(a disk formatter, MkFs, and the Installer), or the much faster install kernel.
Visit <A HREF="#MacBSDWebSites"> the above Web sites</A> for more information.
<P>
Assuming you have enough of Unix (and MacOS!) installed, here is how to boot it:
<UL>
	<LI> Open the BSD/Mac68k Booter from the MacOS. A window will appear entitled
	'BSD/Mac68k Launch'. The default Booter settings should work for most Macs, although
	if your A/UX partitioned drive is not at SCSI ID 0, then you will need to configure the
	Booter
<P>
	<LI> Choose 'Booting...' from the Options menu to open the main 'Boot Options'
	configuration dialog. Configure the boot options in accordance with your system (the
	most commonly changed ones will be 'Root SCSI ID' and 'Kernel Name'). When you have
	finished, click OK
<P>
	<LI> You may wish to edit some of the options under 'Serial ports...' if you want to use
	the serial console or boot echo features, or if you are having trouble booting on a
	machine with interesting serial port hardware (<I>e.g.</I> PowerBooks). If you want to
	log debugging information, you should look in 'Startup...'. All the boot options
	available are documented below in
	<A HREF="#BootOptionsAdNauseam">'Boot Options <I>Ad Nauseam</I>'</A>
<P>
	<LI> After you have configured all the boot options you want, you may wish to save them
	for future boots, using the 'Save Options' command under the File menu
<P>
	<LI> Now choose 'Boot Now' from the Options menu
</UL>

<CENTER> <A NAME="BootProcess"><H2>A Quick Overview of the Boot Process</H2></A> </CENTER>

First off, the Booter must attempt to open the kernel you've specified. If you've specified
a kernel in your BSD partition, it will take a second to search for it. Then the Booter will
(hopefully) identify the kernel as a 68K executable, like this:

<P> <CODE> MID_M68K executable</CODE> </P>
or:
<P> <CODE> 32 bit ELF format</CODE> </P>

Then it will proceed to load the kernel. As the different sections of the kernel are loaded,
numbers will appear in the status window, which look something like this:

<P> <CODE> 1051924/4844+65764+100760+[166104+155973] </CODE> </P>
or:
<P> <CODE> 1132386+2688088+139152 [65+184068+175954] </CODE> </P>

<I>(Here, as in the rest of the boot process, the numbers you get may not be the same as the
numbers I get. They are highly kernel-dependent.)</I> For an a.out kernel, these numbers
correspond to the sizes of the text (executable machine code) section, the page alignment
section, the static data section and the bss (uninitialized data) section, then the symbol
table and the string table, respectively. The final message displayed before the jump to
kernel space should be as follows:

<PRE>  Bye-bye...
        So I sez to him...  The real way
        that it should be done is to...
</PRE>

Then the system will act as if it is restarting, and when the restart would normally happen,
the screen will go blank and a short list of memory mappings will appear, followed by a
copyright notice and autoconfiguration information, which signals that you've booted.

The boot process is not completely machine- and installation-independent. Therefore, the
Booter allows you to set certain options and flags in order to communicate to the kernel
important facts about your machine. Most of these options are set in the
<A HREF="#BootingOptions">'Booting'</A> dialog window, though some are set in the
<A HREF="#SerialOptions">'Serial ports...'</A>, <A HREF="#MonitorOptions">'Monitors'</A>
and the <A HREF="#PrefOptions">'Preferences'</A> dialog windows.

<A NAME="BootingOptions"><H3>Booting dialog window:</H3></A>

<CENTER> <IMG SRC="Booting.GIF" ALT="Picture of Boot Options dialog window"> </CENTER>

<P>

Described below are the options that can be set from the 'Booting' dialog window. In most
cases you should be able to boot after modifying only these options.

<DL>
<DT><B>Kernel Location: Mac OS file or BSD device</B>
	<DD>The chief purpose of the Booter is to load the BSD operating system code into memory.
	This code is called the <I>kernel</I> and is normally contained in a file called
	<CODE>netbsd</CODE>. This file is normally in the root directory of the root partition
	of your BSD file system. However, it is also possible to load kernels from the MacOS
	file system, such as when testing new systems, or on systems where SCSI is not yet
	supported. This boot option lets you select the location of your kernel; if you select
	Mac OS the Booter will look in its own folder for the kernel (or another folder selected
	by pressing the 'Set' button). This option should, as stated above, normally be set to
	BSD device
<DT><B>Kernel Name</B>
	<DD>Normally, the kernel is named <CODE>netbsd</CODE>, and that is what you should enter
	for the Kernel Name. However, if you are testing a recently-installed kernel, or simply
	want to boot an alternate kernel, you can enter that name here too. Note well, however,
	that much BSD software assumes that the kernel is named <CODE>netbsd</CODE> and is in
	the root directory, so if you have a kernel that works well, you should probably name it
	as that
<DT><B>Partition</B>
	<DD>For the Booter to load the kernel from a BSD device, it needs to know which partition
	contains the kernel. Normally, the partition field can be left blank, and the Booter will
	magically locate a suitable root partition.
	<P>If you have more than one such partition on the BSD device, you may want to force it
	to use one of them by entering the name of the partition in the Partition Name field.
	For a MacOS partitioned disk, this would be the name which your disk formatting software
	gave the partition when you created it <I>e.g.</I> 'UNIX Root&Usr slice 0',
	'NetBSD Root & Usr' or 'A/UX Root'. For a disk which contains a Unix disklabel,
	this would be the name of the disk slice <I>e.g.</I> 'sd0a'
	<P> If you do not enter a name, the Booter tries to guess the correct partition. The
	first Unix (<I>i.e.</I> type="Apple_UNIX_SVR2") partition with 'Root' in the name is its
	best guess, and if there isn't one of those, then the first Unix partition which doesn't
	have 'Swap' in it's name is its next best
<DT><B>ATA disk</B>
	<DD>If you want the Booter to get its kernel (and the kernel to mount root) from the
	machine's ATA (IDE) disk, then select this, and fill in the buss/channel and device
	fields
<DT><B>SCSI disk</B>
	<DD>If you want the Booter to get its kernel (and the kernel to mount root) from a SCSI
	device on the machine, then select SCSI disk, and enter the SCSI ID of the drive which
	contains your root partition
<DT><B>Enabled?</B>
	<DD>This option will allow systems to boot without a root device specified, <I>e.g.</I>
	using NFS filesystems. For normal usage you will probably want to leave this on
<DT><B>Single User</B>
	<DD>This option tells the kernel to boot the system in single-user (administrative)
	mode, as opposed to your normal everyday multi-user boot. This can be necessary when
	you're having trouble booting into multi-user, or if you need to edit some files before
	the system finishes booting
<DT><B>Ask for alternate root/swap?</B>
	<DD>This option allows the user to specify an alternate root or swap device right before
	the root partition is mounted. This allows you to, for example, boot off a kernel on the
	first SCSI disk (sd0) and specify that root is on cd0 (a CD-ROM) or sd1 (<I>et cetera</I>
	). For normal usage you will probably want to leave this blank
<DT><B>Extra kernel debugging messages</B>
	<DD>This option tells the kernel to display some extra debugging information
<DT><B>Jump into debugger after booting</B>
	<DD>This flag tells the kernel to go into the debugger (either kgdb or ddb) shortly after
	initialization
<DT><B>GMT Bias and Auto-set GMT Bias</B>
	<DD>This should be a number of minutes which are added to UTC (Coordinated Universal
	Time, also known as Greenwich Mean Time or GMT) to get to your time zone. If you have
	the MacOS Map control panel set with your location, you can enable the 'Auto-set GMT
	Bias' option to set this information
</DL>

<A NAME="SerialOptions"><H3>Serial ports dialog window:</H3></A>

The options in this dialog window, described below, pertain chiefly to the initial settings
of the new zsc/zstty serial driver:

<P>

<CENTER> <IMG SRC="Serial.GIF" ALT="Picture of Serial ports... dialog"> </CENTER>

<P>

<DL>
<DT><B>Serial Boot Echo</B>
	<DD>Output from the kernel will be echoed to the printer port at 9600 baud, no parity,
	8 data bits, 1 stop bit, if this option is checked. (See also the 'Default Serial Speed'
	boxes)
<DT><B>Serial Console (Modem or Printer)</B>
	<DD>The selected serial line will be used as the console, with the same communications
	settings as with Serial Boot Echo (above), if this option is checked. Be careful that
	you do not have a getty process running on the same serial line you are using as the
	console (i.e. do not run getty on both ttye0 and tty00 if Modem port is serial console)
	because this could panic the kernel. Note that you can select a port for the serial
	console, but the serial boot echo is always on the Printer port.
<DT><B>LocalTalk connected to Printer port</B>
	<DD>In some instances the kernel will freeze if it is connected to a high-traffic
	LocalTalk network. Although LocalTalk is not supported in the kernel, if this box is
	checked it will keep the kernel from panicking if it encounters this situation.
<DT><B>Open port before booting (for PowerBook)</B>
	<DD>In order for PowerBooks to use the serial port(s), they must be turned on before
	booting in order to get the Power Manager to turn the power on to the chip and the
	ports. Setting this option should only be necessary if you are booting NetBSD/Mac68k on
	a PowerBook.
<DT><B>Default Serial Speed</B>
	<DD>With NetBSD/Mac68k kernels later than 20th October 1997 (<I>i.e.</I> 1.3), the port
	speed can be set by typing the new speed in here. This might be useful if you want to
	log boot messages to a HP DeskJet printer, for example.
<DT><B>Set Modem (or Printer) port to 'stty raw' defaults</B>
	<DD>This option instructs the kernel to set the defaults for the serial port in question
	to those from the 'stty raw' command. BSD assumes serial ports are hooked up to
	terminals by default, and the default behavior for terminals is for the kernel to echo
	back characters that the user types into the terminal. In 'raw' mode, no assumptions
	are made about what's on the other end of the serial port. Among other changes, no
	characters are echoed back out the port.
	<P>
	The difference is important if your BSD/Mac68k machine is connected to the serial
	interface of an HP DeskWriter printer. They (and possibly other printers) report status
	by sending a character to the host computer. Without this boot option, BSD would
	think that a person was typing these characters and echo them back. But then the printer
	thinks it is supposed to print these characters. On the DeskWriter, these characters can
	come out as ugly white-on-black block letters (garbage). This printing will happen
	seemingly spontaneously, with no intervention from the user. Setting this boot option
	should cure the problem.
	<P>
	This option is probably not appropriate for a serial port hooked to a terminal, as the
	normal terminal defaults are the best in this case.
<DT><B>External clock sources</B>
	<DD>The new zsc/zstty driver (introduced in NetBSD/Mac68k 1.2) tries to support more of
	the options Apple originally foresaw for the Mac's serial ports. One feature is support
	for feeding the Mac a clock from which it will generate the baud rate used to send and
	receive data. Potential uses include talking to certain Personal LaserWriters and
	driving MIDI adapter units.
	<P>
	Each serial port has two input pins, so there are four possible clock rate values.
	When a clock rate is entered, two things happen. First, the associated pin is flagged as
	reserved for a clock, and second, the clock rate is considered when NetBSD requests a
	particular baud rate.
	<P>
	The first action happens as these pins (which have different names under BSD and Mac
	OS) are usually considered as modem signal pins by BSD. The kernel must respond
	accordingly whenever the modem thinks a data carrier has been detected, something which
	would normally happen less than once a second. Clock rates, on the other hand, are
	usually in the millions of cycles per second, so the clock reservation acts as a
	protection for the NetBSD kernel.
	<P>
	Note that one of the pins on the printer port (GPi/DCD) isn't actually usable by the
	baud rate hardware; it corresponds to the fully-featured clock input on the modem port.
	Thus it is included to protect the kernel from a device intended for the modem port yet
	connected to the printer port.
</DL>

<A NAME="MonitorOptions"><H3>Monitors dialog window:</H3></A>

Current kernels and X Windows servers cannot change video modes very well. The BSD/Mac68k
console will work with almost any depth or resolution, but the X Window system (and maybe
the DT multi-window console) cannot.

<P>

For those of you whose use your Macs for MacOS as well as BSD/Mac68k, these options allow
you to keep you MacOS screen the way you like them, and then change the settings just before
booting the BSD/Mac68k kernel:

<P>

<CENTER> <IMG SRC="Monitors.GIF" ALT="Picture of Monitors... dialog"> </CENTER>

<DL>
<DT><B>Change Monitor Colourmap to GreyScale</B>
	<DD>Support for colour is not currently in all X servers, but some of them do support
	256 greys. This option should make X Windows a little more usable on those systems
<DT><B>Change Monitor Depth</B>
	<DD>A set of common depths, some of which your Mac may not support. If the requested
	depth isn't supported, no depth change should occur
<DT><B>Change Monitor Resolution</B>
	<DD>Common MacOS screen sizes, which both your monitor <I>and</I> your Mac may not
	support. If your Mac doesn't support the requested size, the screen may flash, but no
	change should happen. If you monitor doesn't support the requested resolution and scan
	rate, behaviour depends on the monitor and cable. Usually, there will be no resolution
	change. If you have a Mac to PC style cable which is set differently to your monitor's
	capabilities, the monitor may lose sync, and in rare situations, damage may occur
</DL>

<P>

Note that these options only affect the main monitor. They don't currently do anything with
multiple monitor setups.

<A NAME="PrefOptions"><H3>Startup dialog window:</H3></A>

A few more miscellaneous options pertaining to the operation of the Booter itself are in the
Preferences dialog window:

<P>

<CENTER> <IMG SRC="Preferences.GIF" ALT="Picture of Startup... dialog"> </CENTER>

<DL>
<DT><B>Auto boot on startup / Timeout before boot</B>
	<DD>If you have saved your normal boot preferences, you might want to just boot right
	into BSD as soon as you open the Booter. Checking 'Auto boot on startup' will make the
	Booter start booting a specified number of seconds after it starts.
<DT><B>Show dialog & wait for OK before booting</B>
	<DD>If the above option is checked, then a dialog window will appear before booting that
	asks you whether you want to Boot or Cancel. This was implemented so you might read the
	messages in the window before they are blanked out by the appearance of the console
<DT><B>Debugging level</B>
	<DD>Setting the debug level to 1 or greater values gets you lots of debugging spew in
	the status window that can help you diagnose what's going wrong in the boot process.
	But normally you will want to leave this at 0.
<DT><B>Log debugging to file / Set...</B>
	<DD>If you want to keep a log of the messages in the status window, so that you can dump
	it into a mail message or just look at it later, check this box and click on 'Set...' to
	choose where you want the log file created. Note that the Booter will not replace an
	already-existing log file, but will append to it, even though it says "Replace existing
	'bootlog'?" when you save it. Note also that when people ask for a bootlog they usually
	want you to turn debugging on (to level 1 or 2) and use this option. Normally, of
	course, you won't need to keep the bootlog turned on.
<DT><B>No env dumps</B>
	<DD>If this option is <I> not </I> checked, the Booter will dump the boot environment,
	a list of variables not unlike the UNIX process	environment, into the status window
	before booting. If this option <I> is </I> checked, the booter will	not spew this entire
	list of strings into the window before booting. They are nice for bug reports, but
	they do slow down the boot process. This option disabled goes well with 'Show dialog &
	wait for OK before booting' being enabled & a nice, big boot window. :)
<DT><B>Halt on non-fatal errors</B>
	<DD>A few errors (mostly concerning such recondite things as video board interrupt
	errors) are considered non-fatal. If you are having trouble with BSD/Mac68k video,
	you might want to try turning this on, so that you can read the error messages as they
	scroll by. Mostly, though, you'll not need to worry about this; leave it unchecked

</DL>

<A NAME="MachineOptions"><H3>Machine dialog window:</H3></A>

Options relating to the hardware configuration of the machine are in the machine dialog window:

<P>

<CENTER> <IMG SRC="Machine.GIF" ALT="Picture of Machine... dialog"> </CENTER>

<DL>

<DT><B>RAM size and Auto-size RAM</B>
	<DD>You should click Auto-size RAM to have the Booter automatically calculate the amount
	of RAM installed in your computer. This will not be an option in future releases. The
	paranoid can type in the amount of RAM (in megabytes) in the appropriate box as well
<DT><B>Change default MACHINEID (for accelerated Macs) and Machine ID</B>
	<DD>Some clock-chipped or accelerated Macs report a different MACHID to the Mac's base
	hardware, which can prevent the BSD kernel from finding hardware. Checking this box and
	entering the MACHID which matches your model Macintosh should help
<DT><B>No warning on PPC Macs (for testing)</B>
	<DD>The Booter now puts up an alert if executed on a PPC Mac. If you want to do some
	development of the Booter on, say, an iMac (Hi Scott!) then you may want to check this box
<DT><B>Don't disable VBL interrupts on video cards</B>
	<DD>Booter versions after version 1.8 attempt to disable vertical blanking
	(VBL) interrupts on all active video cards found, because current implementations of the
	grf_mv (Macintosh QuickDraw-compatible NuBus video card) driver do not handle VBL
	interrupts reliably. If this process fails (and it should be obvious if it fails; an
	error code is printed and the boot stops) then you should check this box and try booting
	again
<DT><B>Video address hack (for LC475 & 575, pre 1.4 kernels)</B>
	<DD>This option should allow the internal video to be used as the console on these two
	Macs with almost any kernel. These machines use the MMU to remap the video address under
	MacOS, and this mapping is lost when BSD/Mac68k kernel execution begins. Do not use this
	option for any machine other than the LC/Performa 475, 575 & 630 series, as it may cause
	undesired kernel crashes
<DT><B>Disable driver for Sonnet Allegro (on SE, LC, LCII)</B>
	<DD>An accelerator card for some machines comes with a driver which disables the 68030
	at restart and shutdown time. Checking this box prevents this, so that the kernel will
	be able to use the 68030 after the Booter does a shutdown of the MacOS

</DL>

<HR>

<CENTER> <A NAME="CommonErrs"><H2>Common boot Errors</H2></A> </CENTER>

Some of the following errors are practically FAQs on the port-Mac68k list. Some are not.
Any of these could possibly happen to you. This guide can help you understand what is going
wrong. Don't leave MacOS without it!

<DL>

<DT><I>Couldn't locate any partitions on SCSI ID (0). Cannot open kernel (0,?)netbsd.</I>
<DD>This error occurs when the Booter cannot open the partition you specified for the
	kernel. Check for typos in the SCSI ID and/or Partition Name boxes in the 'Booting'
	dialog window.

<P>

<DT><I>File 'foobar' is nonexistent. Cannot open kernel (0,?)foobar.</I>
<DD>This error occurs when the Booter found the partition, but couldn't open the kernel you
	specified. Make sure you specified the right partition, and make sure you didn't mistype
	the name of the kernel (in the 'Booting' dialog window.)

<P>

<DT><I>Cannot malloc()...</I>
<DT><I>malloc() failed...</I>
<DT><I>Not enough free memory to load this kernel.</I>
<DT><I>(et cetera)</I>
<DD>These all mean that the Booter has run out of memory. Increase the Booter's memory
	partition using the 'Get Info' command in the Finder, and try booting again.

<P>

<DT><I>Magic numbers do not match -- Improper UFS partition.</I>
<DD>This means that the Booter went to read the NetBSD partition you specified, and it
	didn't find a valid BSD filesystem there. Did you remember to run Mkfs on the partition?

<P>

<DT><I>Error -nnn turning off interrupts for slot SS</I>
<DT><I>Error -nnn {getting name of,trying to open} slot 0xSS video driver</I>
<DT><I>(et cetera)</I>
<DD>Though these shouldn't happen, if a video card error stops your booting, you might want
	to try booting again with "Don't disable VBL interrupts on video cards" checked in the
	'Booting' dialog window

<P>

<DT><I>Error #-nnn locking kernel memory.</I>
<DD>The Booter is trying to boot with virtual memory enabled, and it couldn't lock the
	kernel buffer in real RAM. Booting with virtual memory enabled is not supported at all,
	and on top of that, it is extremely unlikely to work. You should turn off VM in the
	Memory control panel, restart, and try booting again

<P>

<DT><I>Failed to read executable header from kernel image.</I>
<DT><I>This kernel is not in a format which the Booter can execute.</I>
<DT><I>The kernel does not appear to be a 68k kernel.</I>
<DT><I>Short boot_read. Kernel file corrupt?</I>
<DD>These messages all indicate that the Booter can't imagine that the file you have
	designated as a kernel is really a NetBSD 680x0 executable. It may have become corrupted
	in transfer - you did use binary mode when FTPing, didn't you? - or you may have
	forgotten to untar the kernel

<CENTER> <A NAME="Debug"><H2>Debugging the boot sequence</H2></A> </CENTER>

The Booter is usually very reliable, but there are probably some undiscovered bugs. This
section will help you discover what may go wrong.

<P>

The Booter program is only in memory up until the kernel loads and starts executing. One of
the first things that the kernel does is clear the screen and start putting up console
messages, the first of which is a NetBSD copyright message. If you got past the NetBSD
copyright message, any error is probably not the fault of the Booter. If, however, the boot
sequence fails while there are still MacOS windows on the screen, then it may indeed be a
problem in the Booter.

<P>

The Booter has a number of debug messages that are only output when the 'Debugging Level'
is greater than 0 (the default). The following lists the debug output for each level:

<OL>
<!-- 1><-->
<LI>Summary of Macintosh and MacOS details,
	environment variables being set,
	process names which are being killed,
	debugging level when Booter program starts,
	vertical blanking and video driver info,
	Gestalt call failures,
	BSD block size and inode summaries,
	lots of kernel info dumps
<LI>BSD partition block and directory node reading,
	video address stripping, kernel section pointers
<LI>Details of all MacOS file reads,
	indirect BSD blocks read,
	ELF section info,
	Unix partition flags 
<LI>'sector' information when finding BSD files,
	kernel string table debug
<!-- 5><-->
<LI>Monitor depth and resolution change calls,
	'*' for each non-cached BSD block read,
	ELF header info, string and section table parsing debug
<LI>Hex dump of start of text and data area of kernel
<LI> &nbsp </LI>
<LI> &nbsp </LI>
<LI>Size and location of each disk block read
<!-- 10><-->
<LI>SCSI read block count, ATA disk device information
<LI> &nbsp </LI>
<LI> &nbsp </LI>
<LI> &nbsp </LI>
<LI> &nbsp </LI>
<!-- 15><-->
<LI>Hex dump of each block read by disk_scsi()
</OL>

Note that a debug level of 2 also outputs level 1's output, <I>et cetera</I>.

<P>

While the above list may be bewildering, if you seem to be having a problem with reading the
kernel from a BSD filesystem, then 1 through 5 are the debug levels to try. SCSI buss
problems can be investigated at debugging level 9. Illegal kernel formats may be revealed
by debug level 6. <I> et cetera </I>

<P>

If you think you have found a bug in the Booter, or if you cannot work out all of the
debug output, then you will need to document your system and the problem, and ask for help
from the port-mac68k mailing list.

<UL>
<LI>To accurately document everything, turn on 'Log debugging to file' and try to boot.
	This will generate a MacOS file containing the log window data. You can then e-mail this
	file to the mailing list along with a description of the problem
<LI>For your initial call for help, please keep the debug level to 0 or 1 - any higher is
	too much data for the list subscribers to easily understand
<LI>If you have any NuBus cards installed, you should also detail those
<LI>If you broke into MacsBug, you should include the contents of the Standard Log (type
	StdLog into the MacsBug command buffer and hit return; with luck it will end up in the
	Desktop Folder of your boot disk)
</UL>

<CENTER> <A NAME='Versions'><H2>Booter Versions</H2></A> </CENTER>

The Booter src code package contains two files; <A HREF='ChangeLog.txt'>ChangeLog.txt</A>
and <A HREF='ChangeLog-Old.txt'>ChangeLog-Old.txt</A>, which have a detailed log of
different Booter versions. Here is a summary of the ones you will probably need to know about:

<DL>

<DT> Version: 1.9.4, October 1st, 1996
<DT> Author: Brian Gaeke
<DD><UL><LI> First Booter to support any 68040 (<I>i.e.</I> Quadra-class) machines. Known to
	boot kernels from NetBSD/Mac68k versions 1.1 and later. For kernels older than 1.1,
	your mileage may vary -- in theory the support is still there, but it's not been tried
	in quite a while</UL></DD>

<P>

<DT> Version: 1.11.1, December 3rd, 1997
<DT> Authors: Scott Reynolds, Nigel Pearson 
<DD><UL>
	<LI> User interface improvements, plus the following changes from earlier versions:
	<LI> Allows booting with larger kernels (many post 1.2 kernels require this Booter)
	<LI> New 'Auto Set GMT bias' checkbox which uses the 'Map' Mac OS Control panel to
		 set Unix's time zone information
	<LI> New ability to boot from gzip-ed kernel files
	<LI> New serial fields to set different default serial port speeds
	<LI> New Monitors options which allow changing of the main screen depth before booting
	<LI> If boot is aborted, resets monitor depth
	<LI> Saves preferences in a separate file, rather than in the program's resources
	<LI> Added video address hack for LC475/LC575 Macs' console on internal video
	<LI> Handles kernels in Mac OS files much better
	<LI> Better debugging/error output for low-level SCSI stuff
	</UL></DD>

<P>

<DT> Version: 1.11.4, June 22nd, 1999
<DT> Authors: Nigel Pearson, Marc LaViolette, Mikael Forselius
<DD><UL>
	<LI> New 'Machine' dialog for hardware specific options, fixes for testing on PPCs
	<LI> Extra debug output summarising machine and MacOS details
	<LI> Support for Sonnet Allegro accellerator, ability to change MACHINEID passed
		 into the kernel, plus the following changes from earlier versions:
	<LI> User interface changes and addition of 'jump into debugger after booting'
	<LI> Bug fixes (serial booting, hang if a removable SCSI device was offline,
		 problem with monitor depth & resolution-changing logic)
	<LI> Booter now checks for Virtual Memory, and pops up an alert and exits if used
	<LI> Monitors options now allow changing of main screen's resolution and colour mode
		 (to greys) before booting. The latter is for some of the new Xservers which
		 don't work with colour yet
	<LI> Now correctly kills running applications
	</UL></DD>

<P>

<DT> Version: 2.0.0, August 19th, 2002
<DT> Author: Nigel Pearson
<DD><UL>
	<LI> Allows booting from ELF kernels
	<LI> Keeps removable disks mounted (<I>i.e.</I> no ejection) during boot
	<LI> Ability to boot from disklabelled disks,
		 plus the following changes from earlier versions:
	<LI> Initial support for booting from ATA/IDE disks
	<LI> Fix for gzip re-entrancy bug
	<LI> Some debugging improvements and PPC testing improvements
	</UL></DD>
